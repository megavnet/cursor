# cursor-byok bootstrap

One-line installer that points **Cursor** at your own OpenAI-compatible backend
without patching Cursor's installation files.

It does two things on the client machine:

1. adds a managed block to the system `hosts` file so Cursor's agent hostnames
   (`*.api5.cursor.sh`) resolve to your proxy IP;
2. installs the proxy's local CA into the OS trust store and exports
   `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` so Cursor's Node-based agent host trusts the proxy's TLS
   certificate.

Because nothing inside `Cursor.app` / `Program Files\cursor` is modified, a Cursor
update does not undo the redirect (you may only need to add newly introduced
hostnames — see [Maintenance](#maintenance)).

Default proxy: `139.99.91.234` (override with `-Ip` / `--ip` or `CURSOR_PROXY_IP`).

Pinned to release **v1.1.0** (immutable, CDN-friendly). Replace `v1.1.0` with `main`
if you want the latest commit instead of a release.

## Quick start

### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megavnet/cursor-installer/v1.1.0/install.sh | sudo bash
```

With a custom proxy IP:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megavnet/cursor-installer/v1.1.0/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --ip 203.0.113.10
```

### Windows (PowerShell **as Administrator**)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megavnet/cursor-installer/v1.1.0/install.ps1 | iex
```

With a custom proxy IP:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megavnet/cursor-installer/v1.1.0/install.ps1))) -Ip 203.0.113.10
```

Then **restart Cursor**. On Linux, log out and back in once (or reboot) so the
desktop session inherits `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. On macOS, quit Cursor (Cmd-Q) and
open it again; the installer already set the variable in the GUI session.

### macOS notes

macOS needs one interactive approval to add a root CA to the **System** keychain, and
the Security framework denies it when the script runs over plain SSH. The installer
therefore treats that step as best effort:

* if you run it from **Terminal.app** on the Mac, macOS shows the authorization dialog
  and the CA becomes system-trusted;
* over SSH (no GUI prompt) it prints the exact command to run later, and continues:
  Cursor's agent host is a Node process and trusts `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, which is
  exported through `launchctl` plus a login LaunchAgent. That is enough for chat and
  the agent tool loop.

To trust it system-wide afterwards:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/.cursor-byok-ca.crt
# or: open ~/.cursor-byok-ca.crt in Keychain Access and set "Always Trust"
```

---

## Requirements

* Cursor installed.
* Windows: an **elevated** PowerShell (Run as Administrator).
* Linux/macOS: run with `sudo`.
* Outbound HTTPS to the proxy IP.
* The proxy must be running and serve:
  * `GET /ca.crt` — the CA certificate (plain HTTP on port 80 is fine), and
  * the agent service over HTTP/2 + TLS on port 443.
* Administrator/root rights to edit `hosts` and the trust store.

---

## What gets changed

| Platform | hosts | trust store | env |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `/etc/hosts` (managed block) | `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cursor-byok-ca.crt` + `update-ca-certificates` | `~/.config/environment.d/99-cursor-byok.conf` and `systemctl --user set-environment` |
| Windows | `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (managed block) | `LocalMachine\Root` via `certutil -addstore` | user `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` → `%ProgramData%\cursor-byok\ca-combined.pem` |
| macOS | `/private/etc/hosts` (managed block) | System keychain via `security add-trusted-cert` (needs an interactive approval; best effort over SSH) | `launchctl setenv` in the GUI session + `~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.megavn.cursor-byok.plist` + managed block in `~/.zprofile` |

The hosts entries live between two markers and are rewritten on every run:

```
# BEGIN cursor-byok
<proxy-ip> agent.api5.cursor.sh agentn.api5.cursor.sh ... agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh
# END cursor-byok
```

Hostnames covered:

* `agent.api5.cursor.sh`, `agentn.api5.cursor.sh`
* `agent-gcpp-uswest.api5.cursor.sh`, `agentn-gcpp-uswest.api5.cursor.sh`
* `agentn-gcpp-eucentral.api5.cursor.sh`, `agentn-gcpp-apsoutheast.api5.cursor.sh`
* `agent.global.api5.cursor.sh`, `agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh`
* `agentn-gcpp-uswest.global.api5.cursor.sh`, `agent-gcpp-uswest.global.api5.cursor.sh`
* `agentn-gcpp-eucentral.global.api5.cursor.sh`, `agentn-gcpp-apsoutheast.global.api5.cursor.sh`

## Verify

After restarting Cursor, open a chat and send a message. On the proxy you should see
`POST /agent.v1.AgentService/Run` and the model being proxied.

The installer ends with its own checks: DNS resolution, a TLS request with the installed
CA, and (on macOS) a request made by Cursor's own Electron/Node runtime, which is the
process that actually calls the proxy.

Manual check (Linux/macOS):

```bash
getent hosts agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh     # Linux; macOS: dscacheutil -q host -a name agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh
curl -sS --cacert ~/.cursor-byok-ca.crt https://agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh/ -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n'
# macOS: prove Cursor's runtime trusts the CA
NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/.cursor-byok-ca.crt ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 \
  /Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/MacOS/Cursor -e \
  'require("https").get("https://agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh/",r=>{console.log(r.statusCode);process.exit(0)}).on("error",e=>{console.log(e.code);process.exit(1)})'
```

Windows:

```powershell
Resolve-DnsName agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh -Type A | Select-Object -First 1 IPAddress
```

---

## Uninstall

Linux/macOS (also removes the macOS LaunchAgent and `~/.zprofile` block):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megavnet/cursor-installer/v1.1.0/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --uninstall
```

Windows (elevated):

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megavnet/cursor-installer/v1.1.0/install.ps1))) -Uninstall
```

This removes the hosts block, the CA from the trust store and the env var/file.
On Windows the installer remembers your previous `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` value
(for example a Charles/Proxyman bundle) and restores it instead of clearing it.
Restart Cursor afterwards.

---

## Maintenance

Cursor occasionally introduces new agent hostnames (for example 3.29 moved to
`*.global.api5.cursor.sh`). If chat stops reaching your proxy after an update:

1. check which hostname is contacted (proxy logs, or `Resolve-DnsName` on Windows);
2. add it to the `Hostnames` list in `install.sh` / `install.ps1` and re-run the
   installer.

Because the Cursor installation itself is untouched, updates no longer undo the
redirect — only the hostname list may need refreshing.

## Troubleshooting

* **Cursor shows "Agent and Edit rely on custom models that require a paid subscription"**
  — traffic is still reaching Cursor. Check that every agent hostname resolves to the
  proxy (`Resolve-DnsName agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh` on Windows,
  `getent hosts agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh` on Linux). New Cursor versions may add
  hostnames; update the `Hostnames` list and re-run the installer.
* **TLS error `self signed certificate in certificate chain`** — the CA is not trusted by
  the process. Re-run the installer and restart Cursor from a session that has
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` (log out/in on Linux; on macOS check
  `launchctl getenv NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` inside the GUI session).
* **macOS: chat fails but `curl` works** — Cursor was still running when the installer
  set the environment. Quit it (Cmd-Q, not just closing the window) and reopen, or run
  `sudo security add-trusted-cert …` in Terminal.app to trust the CA system-wide.
* **Commands hang / "Running command" forever** — the proxy must fall back from HTTP/2
  shell streaming to plain shell execution for older Cursor builds; make sure you run a
  current proxy image.

## Security notes

* The CA private key stays on the proxy; clients only receive the certificate.
* The managed hosts block is easy to audit and remove (`--uninstall`).
* Anyone with access to the proxy has access to the API keys configured on it —
  keep the proxy and its credentials private.
